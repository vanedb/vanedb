# vanedb-cpp

## Overview
Embeddable vector database for edge AI. Header-only C++20, SIMD-optimized, cross-platform.

## Role in the VaneDB Project

This is the **C++ header-only** implementation in the `cpp/` directory. The
Rust implementation lives at the repository root and is the primary entry
point for Rust (`cargo add vanedb`), Python (`pip install vanedb`), and WASM
consumers.
This implementation also provides supplementary Python bindings as
`pip install vanedb-cpp` / `import vanedb_cpp`; it does not own the canonical
`vanedb` PyPI name.

**Why two implementations:**
- **C++** (this component): drop a header into any CMake/Bazel project. No Rust
  toolchain needed. The embed path for iOS/Android native code and existing C++
  codebases.
- **Rust**: cleaner concurrency, ergonomic Python/WASM bindings, the path for new
  language ecosystems.

**Alignment policy:** Features generally land in Rust first. C++ syncs core
algorithms, distance functions, and the universal on-disk persistence contract.
Shared regression vectors and cross-load fixtures live in `../conformance/`.
Intentional divergence remains at the edges — WASM is Rust-only; the header-only
embed path is C++-only.

## Current Status: v0.1.0 (frozen for sync work)

### Features
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Distance Functions | L2, Cosine, Dot (ARM NEON, x86 AVX2) |
| VectorStore | In-memory k-NN, thread-safe |
| HNSWIndex | Approximate NN with save/load |
| MMapVectorStore | Memory-mapped zero-copy |
| GPU Acceleration | Metal (Apple Silicon). CUDA experimental — unwired, untested |
| Python Bindings | pybind11 + NumPy |
| Mobile | iOS arm64, Android arm64-v8a/x86_64 |

### Test Coverage
- 38 C++ test cases (131k+ assertions)
- 28 Python tests
- 3 GPU tests (Metal)
- Sanitizers: ASan + UBSan clean

### Performance
- CPU SIMD: 3.8x speedup vs scalar (768d)
- L2 distance: ~100ns (768d, Apple Silicon)
- GPU: 3.9x speedup at 500k vectors (persistent buffers)

## API
```cpp
// Distance
float d = vanedb::l2_sq(a, b, dim);

// VectorStore
vanedb::VectorStore store(768, vanedb::DistanceMetric::COSINE);
store.add(id, vec);
auto results = store.search(query, k);

// HNSWIndex
vanedb::HNSWIndex idx(768, vanedb::DistanceMetric::COSINE, 100000);
idx.add(id, vec);
idx.save("index.bin");

// GPU (Metal)
auto& gpu = vanedb::gpu::MetalCompute::get();
auto buf = gpu.upload(vectors, n, dim);
auto dists = gpu.search(query, buf, dim, n, vanedb::gpu::MetalMetric::L2);
```

## Demo: Obsidian Semantic Search

A working semantic search tool built on VaneDB demonstrating real-world usage:
```bash
python3 search.py index ~/path/to/vault   # Index notes
python3 search.py find "your query"       # Search
python3 search.py interactive             # REPL mode
```

## Maintenance Posture

This C++ component accepts:
- Bug fixes and CVE patches
- Performance work on hot paths (HNSW search, SIMD distance)
- New platform/compiler support (CI matrix expansion)
- On-disk format additions that mirror the Rust component (so files are
  interchangeable when feasible)
- Packaging and release fixes for the supplementary `vanedb-cpp` Python
  distribution

This C++ component defers to the Rust component for:
- New high-level features (batch search API, metadata filtering, PQ, sharding)
- Language bindings beyond Python (Node/WASM, Swift, Go)
- Canonical `vanedb` PyPI distribution work and npm packaging

The canonical PyPI distribution (`pip install vanedb`), WASM, and
batch/metadata APIs are owned by the Rust component and tracked in this
repository's issue tracker.

## Known Limitations
- No deletion in HNSWIndex (rebuild required)
- GPU requires dim % 4 == 0
- VectorStore `get()` pointer invalidated by writes
- Single-file persistence (no sharding)
